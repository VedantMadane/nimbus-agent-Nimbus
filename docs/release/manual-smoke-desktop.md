# Manual Smoke Checklist — Tauri Desktop UI

Run this end-to-end on **every supported platform** before pushing the future `desktop-v0.1.0` release tag. Anything blocking is a release-stopper for the desktop tag — it does **not** gate the headless `v0.1.0` tag.

This consolidates the three Tauri-only per-workstream checklists (WS5-A app shell + onboarding, WS5-B dashboard + tray + HITL, WS5-C / WS5-D settings panels). It was extracted from [`docs/release/manual-smoke-headless.md`](./manual-smoke-headless.md) when the desktop release vehicle was moved out of `v0.1.0` and into Phase 13 (Desktop Distribution) — see [`docs/roadmap.md` § Phase 13](../roadmap.md#phase-13--desktop-distribution).

## Release vehicle

The Tauri desktop UI ships under its own tag (`desktop-v0.1.0`) as the Phase 13 deliverable. The `v0.1.0` tag ships only the headless gateway + CLI binaries and the VS Code extension. A separate release pipeline job (`build-ui` matrix per OS) is required before the desktop tag can be cut; see Phase 13 § "Desktop Release Vehicle".

## Test environment

| Platform | Terminal / Shell | Build target |
|---|---|---|
| Windows 11 | Windows Terminal (PowerShell 7) | Tauri release build + headless gateway |
| macOS 13+ Apple Silicon | Terminal.app, iTerm2 | Tauri release build + headless gateway |
| macOS 13+ Intel | Terminal.app, iTerm2 | Tauri release build + headless gateway |
| Ubuntu 24.04+ | gnome-terminal | Tauri release build + headless gateway |

Each platform runs every section. Record observations inline. Mark blocked items 🚧 with a tracking-issue link; mark passed-with-caveat items ⚠ and describe inline.

## Preconditions

- A clean OS user account (no prior `nimbus.toml`, no prior data dir) — at least one platform should run the **fresh install** path.
- Nimbus Gateway built and installed (`bun run build:release` or platform installer).
- Tauri desktop UI built (`cd packages/ui && bunx tauri build`) or running in dev (`bunx tauri dev`).
- At least two connectors authenticated (e.g. filesystem + GitHub). One should be in a deliberately broken state to exercise degraded-health UI.
- A valid Nimbus backup `.tar.gz` from a previous export available for the import test.

## 1. App shell + onboarding (WS5-A)

### 1.1 First-run onboarding (fresh install)

- [ ] App opens to `/onboarding/welcome` when no `onboarding_completed` meta exists.
- [ ] Welcome page renders heading + Continue / Skip.
- [ ] **Skip** → navigates to `/`; relaunch does **not** show onboarding again.
- [ ] **Continue** → navigates to `/onboarding/connect` showing 6 connector cards (Google Drive, GitHub, Slack, Linear, Notion, Gmail).
- [ ] Clicking a card toggles selection highlight + checkmark.
- [ ] **Authenticate** is disabled with no selection; with ≥ 1 selected it shows "Authenticating…" per card.
- [ ] A connector that completes OAuth flips to "Connected"; once any connector connects, app navigates to `/onboarding/syncing`.
- [ ] Syncing page shows live item-count incrementing every ~5 s.
- [ ] **Open Dashboard** navigates to `/`.

### 1.2 Returning-user routing

- [ ] Relaunch with existing data → routes directly to `/`.
- [ ] Relaunch after Skip (meta set, zero items) → routes to `/`.

### 1.3 System tray

- [ ] Tray icon appears on launch.
- [ ] Right-click tray menu shows "Open Nimbus" + "Quit".
- [ ] "Open Nimbus" focuses the main window.
- [ ] "Quit" exits the app and the tray icon disappears.
- [ ] Icon style matches OS conventions (monochrome template on macOS).

### 1.4 Quick Query (global hotkey)

- [ ] `Ctrl+Shift+N` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+N` (macOS) opens the popup.
- [ ] Popup is frameless, ≈ 560×220, floats above other windows.
- [ ] Input auto-focused on open.
- [ ] Typing a prompt + Enter streams tokens into the response area.
- [ ] Model label appears bottom-right after stream completes.
- [ ] Popup auto-closes ≈ 2 s after stream finishes.
- [ ] `Esc` closes the popup immediately; clicking outside closes after 150 ms debounce.
- [ ] Pressing the hotkey while the popup is open **focuses** the existing popup (no second instance).

### 1.5 Gateway-offline + hotkey-conflict banners

- [ ] `nimbus stop` → "Gateway is offline" banner appears in the main window within 2 s.
- [ ] **Start Gateway** spawns `nimbus start`; banner clears on reconnect.
- [ ] When the global hotkey can't be registered (manual: bind `Ctrl+Shift+N` in another app first), the toolbar shows the conflict banner; **Dismiss** hides it for the session.

### 1.6 IPC method allowlist

- [ ] DevTools console: `window.__nimbus.call("admin.reset")` (or any unlisted method) → `MethodNotAllowedError`; no Rust panic.

### 1.7 macOS window chrome

- [ ] Main window uses transparent title bar with hidden title text.
- [ ] App does **not** appear in the Dock (accessory mode active).
- [ ] App appears in Cmd+Tab only when a window is visible.

---

## 2. Dashboard, tray health, HITL popup (WS5-B)

### 2.1 Dashboard

- [ ] Main window opens to Dashboard within 2 s.
- [ ] Metric strip shows non-zero values (items, embeddings, p95, size).
- [ ] Connector tiles render with health dot + last-sync time.
- [ ] Hovering a degraded tile shows `degradationReason` in a tooltip.
- [ ] Audit feed lists recent entries newest-first.
- [ ] Switching away for 1 minute → no network activity (verify in DevTools Network tab); return → immediate refetch.
- [ ] `nimbus stop` → offline banner; Dashboard keeps last-known values with a "stale" chip.

### 2.2 Aggregate-health tray

- [ ] Force a connector to `degraded` (revoke a credential) → tray icon turns amber within 30 s.
- [ ] Force a connector to `unauthenticated` → tray icon turns red.
- [ ] Tray menu shows a "Connectors ▸" submenu populated from `set_connectors_menu`.
- [ ] Clicking a connector in the submenu opens Dashboard and flashes the matching tile for 1.5 s.

### 2.3 HITL popup

- [ ] `nimbus ask "create a file called test.md"` (or any consent-gated action) → popup opens within 1 s.
- [ ] Popup window is frameless, 480×360, always-on-top, **not** in the taskbar.
- [ ] Popup shows prompt + structured preview + Approve / Reject.
- [ ] Approve → Gateway proceeds; audit row appears in Dashboard feed within 10 s; popup closes.
- [ ] Trigger two consent requests rapidly → popup shows "+1 more pending"; after the first approve, the second becomes head.
- [ ] Reject → action aborts; audit row shows `rejected`.
- [ ] Close popup (X) without responding → tray badge shows `1`; clicking tray "Pending actions" re-opens popup with the same request.
- [ ] Trigger a `file.delete` consent request → Approve does **not** receive initial focus (deny-list).

## Results matrix

Fill this in as each platform completes. Legend: ✅ passed · 🚧 blocked (link issue) · ⚠ passed with caveat (describe inline).

| Platform | 1. App shell | 2. Dashboard + HITL | 3. Settings |
|---|---|---|---|
| Windows 11 | | | |
| macOS Apple Silicon | | | |
| macOS Intel | | | |
| Ubuntu 24.04 | | | |

A platform is **desktop-release-ready** when every section in its row is ✅ or ⚠ (with the caveat documented). Any 🚧 is a desktop-release blocker — link the issue, do not flip.

## Release gate

When every row is ✅/⚠ across the matrix, **and** the prerequisite work in Phase 13 § "Desktop Release Vehicle" is complete (build-ui matrix job, code-signing certs procured, signed installer pipeline green), push `desktop-v0.1.0` to publish the Tauri installers.

If a regression is found after a tag push, do **not** delete the tag — issue a `desktop-v0.1.1` with the fix and a release note describing the rollback path.
